# Software-Engineering-2-Capstone

Created and designed project based on implementing an idea for a marketplace with fellow team members.

Included is a list of requirements, provided by our client who was our teacher Dr. Michael Thornton.

Database schemas were created with mockups of interfaces as well as a simple dictionary to establish key words for project cohesion.

The idea is to show the ability to design a complex system or program to then later implement.
